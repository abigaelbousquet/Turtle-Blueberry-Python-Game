# Turtle-Blueberry-Python-Game
An interactive game where a user can win points by moving a turtle around the screen with their keyboard 
to eat a delicious dinner of blueberries scattered randomly over the user's screen.

This program will generate a game where the user can use their mouse, arrow keys, and their "g" key to move
blueberries to a turtle in order to "feed" it. Successfully feeding the blueberries to the turtle will
increase their score by 1 each time.
